  - quote: >-
      Ed is the Chief Engineer of a 172 room hotel in the New England region. 
      
      Ed heard about our water sensor device from a friend who had recommended our device. Ed was interested in anything that could help his workload as he was overwhelmed and needed better tools. We were a better tool. Ed invited us to demo install 20 units across five floors. It took us 45 minutes during room turnover and he was up and running. In the first month, we found two water loss events that convinced him that we were the tool he was looking for. On a weekend of a college sporting event, we received alerts from our devices that caused us to call Ed at 4:30 AM on a Saturday morning. For the prior 10 hours, the toilet in the Presidential Suite on the top floor was pouring water at a very high rate, costing almost $36.00 per day! The broken unit consumed about 1,000 gal between the time that we called Ed and he was able to see the room. The average water consumption of the other 19 rooms over this period was 12 gal. When our team went to take a look, we found that the toilet was broken with the inline valve trying to stop it from leaking on the floor. While most of it was going down the overflow tube, it would have gone undetected for a week or two until someone found it, or worse, the water hitting the floor could have seeped into rooms below.
      
      Ed, his general manager and their CFO became our biggest fans.

      The Situation: Joe is a landlord that owns over 10 properties. One of Joe’s
      tenants requested a new toilet that is more water efficient. Without knowing how 
      much water was currently consumed, Joe was uncertain if this would be a worthwhile 
      investment. The Solution: After using FirstDrops™ for one month, he was easily able to see that the tenant was using an average of 59 gallons of water, about $1, each day in one fixture. After this, he made the decision to upgrade to a more efficient toilet as the payback was about 20 months. It was clearly a good investment.
