## The Problem: 
#### More than one trillion gallons of water are wasted each year in the U.S. alone, and much of that comes from hotels and multifamily dwellings.

Minor water leaks are not minor at all. Toilet leaks, dripping taps, and malfunctioning valves cause staggering water loss and damage throughout the world. The EPA estimates that more than one trillion gallons of water are wasted each year in the U.S. alone. 
The negative impact on the environment is undeniable, notably in areas affected by water scarcity. The negative financial impact is a growing concern, especially for hotels and multifamily dwellings, which use more water per square foot than any other property type â€“ by a wide margin. Most water problems creep into the bottom line slowly and owners/managers may not notice. But drop by drop, both a precious natural resource and money are going down the drain.
