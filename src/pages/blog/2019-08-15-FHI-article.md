Internet of Things (IoT) developer FlowActive, previously Mobius Labs, has been awarded a $750,000 grant (€672,666) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support the commercialisation of its FirstDrops™ water leak detection product.

The start-up, which is based in Albany in the US, expects commercial sales of the product to begin by the end of 2019. In July, the company received the Center for Economic Growth’s Technology Innovation Award.

FirstDrops has been designed to help owners of high occupancy buildings to identify leaks before they cause major problems with significant costs. The products are currently being demonstrated and operated in local apartment complexes and commercial buildings in the US, as well as in Marriot, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Doubletree hotels.
